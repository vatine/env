# The "env" library

This is a partial implementation of bash variable expansion for Go.

At the moment, it is missing several expansions (length,
capitalisation, match-deletion), but what is probably the most common
are implemented.

The main entrypoint is also (currently) missing, so not necessarily
super-.useful right at the moment.
